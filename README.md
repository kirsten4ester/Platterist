# Project 2: 


## Project Description

<!-- Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality. -->

## Project Links

<!-- - [github repo]()
- [deployment]() -->

## Wireframes

<!-- Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe.

- [wireframes]()
- [react architecture]()


Define the the React components and the architectural design of your app. -->


- [WireFrame1](https://i.imgur.com/9B9LvCJ.jpg)
- [WireFrame2](https://i.imgur.com/RvUZz9c.jpg)

### Components
- Main.js --- the main page holding the input search bar/button
- Results.js --- results page that will hold the results, album cover, return to main button
--- print.js --- component that will display the search results
--- image.js --- component that will display correlating album image
--- search.js --- button that will return user to main.js

<!-- ##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav |  -->


### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

<!-- The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.   -->

### MVP:
A working (mobile) app that has a search/input box. Once searched, the app will deliver the pieces of information (i.e., artist, year of song, album title, album image, link to lyrics)

### Alternate ideas/ Post-MVP:
music/ trivia game of rolling songs/titles. then having to guess artist (input)
Spotify link to bring directly to song (?)
implementing video background of spinning vinyl
add to favorites feature -- then requiring login/account(?) 


## Time Frames
Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Additional Libraries
 <!-- Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc.  -->
 - ReactStrap

## Code Snippet

<!-- Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
function reverse(string) {
	// here is the code to reverse a string of text
}
``` -->

## Issues and Resolutions
 <!-- Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution. -->
